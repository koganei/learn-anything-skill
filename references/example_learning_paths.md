- Day-to-Day / Implementation / Development
- Modernization / Migration / Refactoring
- Quality / Testing / Monitoring
- Architecture / Design / Planning
- Integration / Deployment / Operations
- Collaboration / Team / Workflow

### Progression Principles

**Foundations must:**
- Require no prerequisites (except language basics)
- Cover essential concepts everyone needs
- Progress from simplest to slightly more complex
- Build confidence with quick wins

**Intermediate should:**
- Assume foundation knowledge
- Combine concepts from foundations
- Address practical application
- Show real-world patterns

**Advanced can:**
- Assume both foundation and intermediate knowledge
- Cover complex scenarios
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Address production concerns

**Use cases must:**
- Be independently accessible (within reason)
- Address specific scenarios
- Show complete examples
- Integrate multiple concepts

### Dependency Management

**Clear prerequisites:**
```markdown
**Prerequisites:** Topics 1-3 (Understanding useState, useEffect, and Rules of Hooks)
```

**Suggested order:**
```markdown
**Recommended before:** Topic 6 (Custom Hooks)
**Can be learned alongside:** Topic 8 (useReducer)
```

**Optional dependencies:**
```markdown
**Helpful but not required:** Topic 5 (Component Lifecycle)
**Builds on:** The concepts from Topic 2, but can be understood independently
```

### Recommendation Patterns

**For absolute beginners:**
```markdown
**💡 Recommendation:**
Start with Topic 01 to understand the fundamentals. The learning path is designed to build progressively, so following topics 1-5 in order will give you a solid foundation.
```

**For those with some experience:**
```markdown
**💡 Recommendation:**
If you're familiar with basic [concept], start with Topic 06. Topics 1-5 cover foundations you may already know, but feel free to review them if you need a refresher.
```

**For specific goals:**
```markdown
**💡 Recommendation:**
Looking to [specific goal]? Jump to Topic [X] in the [category] section. You may want to review Topic [Y] first if you're not familiar with [prerequisite concept].
```

### Topic Naming Conventions

**Good topic names:**
- "Understanding useState for State Management" (Clear scope, action-oriented)
- "Fetching Data with Hooks" (Specific use case)
- "Advanced Performance: useMemo and useCallback" (Level indicated, specific techniques)
- "Migrating Class Components to Hooks" (Clear task and goal)

**Avoid:**
- "State" (Too vague)
- "Everything About Hooks" (Too broad)
- "Lesson 5" (No context)
- "Advanced Topics" (Not specific)

### Balancing Depth and Breadth

**Comprehensive topic (TypeScript):**
- More topics (16)
- Covers language comprehensively
- Multiple use case categories

**Focused topic (React Hooks):**
- Moderate topics (17)
- Specific API within larger framework
- Targeted use cases

**Practical skill (Git):**
- Fewer topics (14)
- Focus on workflows and commands
- Heavy emphasis on collaboration

**Specialized practice (Testing):**
- Compact (13 topics)
- Deep dive into specific skill
- Application-type use cases
